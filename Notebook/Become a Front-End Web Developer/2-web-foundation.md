### URL

URL - Universal Resource Locator
An URL is quite literally a locator following a universal standard that points at a specific resource somewhere on the web.

A URL is entered in the address bar. When the user hits Return or touches the button on their phone or something else, the browser sends a get request to this URL, which asks the server on the other side to send back all the data it has.

DNS - Domain Name Server

The URL is sent to a domain name server, known more commonly as DNS. The DNS figures out which IP address the domain is pointing at, and passes the request to the server on that IP address. The server retrieves all the data, aka the resource, and sends it back to the browser.

### Page Struture

Look a little bit deeper, and what we find is a carefully-structured document displayed as a collection of boxes with different properties.

  - there's a header section containing the site title, logo, and a navigation menu. 
  - there's the main section containing an article which in turn contains a heading or collection of paragraphs and an image.
  - there's a sidebar section with some advertising.
  - there's a footer section with company information.
