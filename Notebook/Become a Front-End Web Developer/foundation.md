### Types of Web Developers
-----
A web developer builds and maintains content for the web, targeting different platforms: desktop, tablets, and handheld mobile devices. 

#### Front-end developers
Work with languages that render in the browser, which is also called a client. Front-end developers work primarily with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are known as front-end technologies because it represents what's in front of the user as they interact with a website.

#### Back-end developers
Some sites require a special server because certain content has to be customized for each user based on their data. That type of development is called back-end development because most of the action is not happening in front of the user, but on a server in the background. 

#### Full-stack developers
Someone who works with all the different layers of web development is sometimes referred to as a full-stack developer. Realistically, all web developers have to have an understanding of the whole stack. A stack is the set of the tools, both front-end and back-end, that a company uses to build its web presence. 


### HTML
-----
HTML stands for ***HyperText Markup Language***. It describes the content and defines the structure within a webpage. 

A front end developer has to understand the relationship of the entire site, and how documents relate to one another. This is called ***information architecture***, and it involves how best to structure a site, how a user is going to navigate, and what type of access users need to other content. 

The second part of HTML is the ***markup language***. That's the set of tags that are added to the text of a webpage to define its structure.  It defines the role each piece of content will have. Some content will become the main headline, while other content links in the navigation. Some tags describe non-textual elements like images or video. 

Markup does something else that's really important. It generates the **DOM**, or *Document Object Model*. The DOM describes the structure of the page, and it's sort of like an outline or a map of the content within a website.


### CSS
-----
Design is one of the tasks where you'll notice specialization within the different typed of developers. The ones more interested into finding the look and feel of a site, and enjoy working on the ***User Experience***, or **UX**. And then there are those who prefer to work on the ***functionality of a site***, called **UI**.

Web design also requires a good understanding of how people experience sites and browse content. It means learning about how navigation drives the user experience, and how to present content to the user.

CSS stands for ***Cascading Style Sheets***. CSS is about defining a set of rules, or style sheets, for how the DOM is translated into visual form. The second part is the cascading style rules. Those are a set of rules that describe the priority of how the styles are rendered on a page.

The CSS language is always changing. There have been three major revisions and the third revision CSS3, has been split into independent modules that will expand in the future.
