###  What is programming?
-----
Programming is the process of converting ideas into instructions that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions are specific and sequential. Order matters. It's all about giving computers the right instructions and the correct sequence of steps to produce the desired result. This is important because programming is just as much about finding errors and preventing crashes as it is about writing the instructions or code that the computer understands.

### C++
```
int main()
{
  std::cout<< "Hello, world!";
  return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```
document.write('Hello, world!');
```

### Python
```
print "Hello, world!"
```

Typically, languages like C, C++, and Objective-C are known as compiled language, whereas PHP and JavaScript are known as interpretive languages. And finally, Java, C# and Python use the combination approach. 

**IDE** - *Integrated Development Environments*. IDEs provide features that speed up code development.
