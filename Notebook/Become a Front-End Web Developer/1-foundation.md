### Types of Web Developers
-----
A web developer builds and maintains content for the web, targeting different platforms: desktop, tablets, and handheld mobile devices. 

#### Front-end developers
Work with languages that render in the browser, which is also called a client. Front-end developers work primarily with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are known as front-end technologies because it represents what's in front of the user as they interact with a website.

#### Back-end developers
Some sites require a special server because certain content has to be customized for each user based on their data. That type of development is called back-end development because most of the action is not happening in front of the user, but on a server in the background. 

#### Full-stack developers
Someone who works with all the different layers of web development is sometimes referred to as a full-stack developer. Realistically, all web developers have to have an understanding of the whole stack. A stack is the set of the tools, both front-end and back-end, that a company uses to build its web presence. 


### HTML
-----
HTML stands for ***HyperText Markup Language***. It describes the content and defines the structure within a webpage. 

A front end developer has to understand the relationship of the entire site, and how documents relate to one another. This is called ***information architecture***, and it involves how best to structure a site, how a user is going to navigate, and what type of access users need to other content. 

The second part of HTML is the ***markup language***. That's the set of tags that are added to the text of a webpage to define its structure.  It defines the role each piece of content will have. Some content will become the main headline, while other content links in the navigation. Some tags describe non-textual elements like images or video. 

Markup does something else that's really important. It generates the **DOM**, or *Document Object Model*. The DOM describes the structure of the page, and it's sort of like an outline or a map of the content within a website.


### CSS
-----
Design is one of the tasks where you'll notice specialization within the different typed of developers. The ones more interested into finding the look and feel of a site, and enjoy working on the ***User Experience***, or **UX**. And then there are those who prefer to work on the ***functionality of a site***, called **UI**.

Web design also requires a good understanding of how people experience sites and browse content. It means learning about how navigation drives the user experience, and how to present content to the user.

CSS stands for ***Cascading Style Sheets***. CSS is about defining a set of rules, or style sheets, for how the DOM is translated into visual form. The second part is the cascading style rules. Those are a set of rules that describe the priority of how the styles are rendered on a page.

Example [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/)

The CSS language is always changing. There have been three major revisions and the third revision CSS3, has been split into independent modules that will expand in the future. 

### JavaScript
-----
Everyone who works in the world of web development has to be comfortable with a certain amount of programming. For front-end development that means learning about JavaScript, the language responsible for managing interaction within a browser. JavaScript interacts with the DOM handling events, loading and unloading media, and creating, modifying, and deleting elements in a page. 

Developers also have to worry about browser support issues because the language has matured rapidly, browsers don't always keep up with the latest changes and improvements. JavaScript doesn't behave in the same in every browser, and debugging this code can be specially frustrating but is a necessary part of the job.

JavaScript has also been implemented on the server side and it's often used in a development workflow as a way to manage and control the development experience. That means doing things like compressing or combining code to make it run faster using workflow tools like NodeJS, WebPack, and GulpJS. 

### Backend Essential
-----
Massive amounts of information makes it impractical to custom-build every single page using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That means using a database to manage the flow of information sent to the user. Web developers need to understand database software, how it handles user information, and the programming languages that serve content based on that data.

New web developers need to study at least one of the platforms for back end development, and at least one language for dealing with data. And if I had to pick only one stack to learn, it would have to be the combination of PHP and SQL.

### Servers
-----
When you access a website, a machine that runs specialized software sends content to your browser. Now these machines are called servers because they serve up information. A server often builds pages that are customized based on different parameters that web developers control. Most larger sites handle this by running software that manages the scheduling of content. Now back end or full stack developers are in charge of building and maintaining these systems. 

### Server-side Scripting
-----
Back end developers work with a different type of language called server-side scripting. As the name implies, that means working with code that runs on a server. The main server-side web development programming languages are PHP, NodeJS, .NET, ASP.NET, Ruby, as well as Python. 

Some of these are married to a specific type of server operating system. .NET, for example, is a Windows server-only platform. Some, like PHP, can run on any platform and operating system, but there are some minor differences in implementation based on the server. 

### Database Languages
-----
In order to work with data on the back-end, web developers need to be familiar with a separate language that lets their code ask or query databases for information. Most servers use a variant of a ***Relational DataBase Management System***, or **RDBMS** called Sequel, or **SQL**. This language works by creating a series of tables, like Excel spreadsheets, with different fields, which can link together to create relationships between the data. Other popular NoSQL languages include MongoDB, Couch Base, and Couch DB. 

### Essential Tools
-----
These are so common that most websites use at least one of these. First, I'll mention Bootstrap, a framework which helps you build websites with an easy-to-learn but powerful grid system and excellent interactive features. jQuery standardizes the way that JavaScript works in different browsers, and give you additional features that make it easier to build interactions. JavaScript frameworks like Angular.js and React provide libraries that help you build single page applications and interfaces. Finally, you may want to explore WordPress, a popular content management system that powers 25% of all sites on the web.
